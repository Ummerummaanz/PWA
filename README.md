# Feature App template

## Usage

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn run init {name} {port}`

Where `name` is the name of the feature app (i.e. `backup`) and `port` is the port number the feature app will be running on.

The above will have a simple runnable feature app and will also initialize a new git repository pointing to `oasis/feature-{name}`
